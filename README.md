  ## Description

  Portfolio generator was built to assist users in creating a personal portfolio to display some of their best work for potential spectators. Utilizing NodeJS, inquirer, and the file system module, portfolio generator asks the user a series of questions from the command line about. Users will answer questions about themselves as well as iterate through project specific questions. Once all the questions have been answered, the system will generate an index.html page with an associated stylesheet that users can download and have a fully working webpage displaying their projects.

  ## Usage

  After the user invokes the applicaiton, they will be asked a series of questions about themselves. Most questions are required where a few are optional. After the user answer questions about themselves, they will then be asked a series of questions about a project that they want to be generated on the page. One all the questions have been answered about the one particular project, users will then be asked if they want to include another project. This process will iterate until the user is done adding projects. After they have finished including all of their projects, the system will generate the index.html file as well as include a stylesheet that goes with it that are both ready for download.
